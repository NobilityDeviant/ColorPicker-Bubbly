Yet another open source color picker for Android. So, why should you use this color picker? It is highly customizable and easy to use. You can simply add the `ColorPreference` to your preferences and a beautiful color picker dialog will be displayed without additional code. The color picker supports alpha and allows you to set your own presets.

The original ColorPickerView was written by [Daniel Nilsson](https://github.com/danielnilsson9/color-picker-view).

Don't use this once. It is a personal project with customizations 
only for my app.
